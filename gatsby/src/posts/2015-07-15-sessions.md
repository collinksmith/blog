Because HTTP requests are stateless, you need to take  special measures in order to remember a user between HTTP requests. The most common way to do this is to use the browser's cookies. 

Upon logging in, your app will create a random string to serve as the <em>session token</em>. This token will go in the browser's cookies, as well as in your app's database in that specific user's session_token column. Now, whenever a request is made, your server can check the browser's cookie against the session_token column of your users table to see if the request is coming from a currently logged in user.

Rails makes it easy to set and retrieve cookies in the browser via the `session` hash. To set the browser's cookie, all you need to do is `session[:session_token] = radom_token_string`. When the user logs out, you should set this cookie data back to nil and change the session_token for the user in your database to end the session.
