Raty is a jquery plugin that makes it easy to add stars to your site that allow users to rate things. The best resources are the [github docs][1] and this page of [examples][2].

To get started, follow this format: `$(#div-id).raty(options)`. If you're using images for the stars, you'll need to specify the location of those images with the `starOn` and `starOff` options.

If you want to send the values to your server upon submitting a form, you just need to put the HTML elements inside your `<form>` tag. After submitting the form, the values will be available in the form data. You can set the name of the values with the `scoreName` option. For example, to follow a rails naming convention, you might set the `scoreName` for your overall rating to `review[overall]`.
