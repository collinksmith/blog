  <p>This is where I'll be blogging about my journey as I learn to code. The purpose is twofold:
    <ol type='1'>
      <li><em>Solidify my knowledge.</em> Summarizing and reviewing what I learn each day will force me to use active recall and help me remember it long term. Putting it in writing will force me to have a solid grasp of the material.</li>
      <li><em>Document what I've learned.</em> This will provide a resource for me to refer back to later if I need to jog my memory about a topic, and for potential employers or contractors to see what I've learned.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>If you like or want to respond to something I've written, don't hesitate to <a href="http://collinsmith.me/contact">let me know</a> by emailing or tweeting at me!</p>
